# Socket.IO Chat with ability to see others' messages while typing.
A simple [chat demo](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/tree/master/examples/chat) using the  [socket.io](http://socket.io/) real-time bidirectional event library for Node.js.

Multiple users can join a chat room by each entering a unique username
when the website loads. Users can type chat messages to the room, and a notification is sent to all users when another user joins or leaves.
